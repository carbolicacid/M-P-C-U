1. Find the Common Cathode code for all Hexadecimal Numbers (0 – F) where "a" is MSB
and "p" is LSB. Show 0 to F one by one. Keep Pin Array Unchanged (a, b, ...., g, p)
2. Take an input from user using serial monitor. After that show all the numbers that are
multiple of user inputs in the range of Є [0, F]. After showing all multiples turn off the

If user input = 7
Show → 7, E (then Turn OFF)
