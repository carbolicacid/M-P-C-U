1. Consider that last digit of your Student ID is “x”. Connect two LEDs of different color at
digital pin “x” and “9 - x”. Write a code so that they blink in the following direction
indefinitely –

Time LED 1 (at Dpin x) LED 2 (at Dpin 9-x)
0 – 1 s ON OFF
1 – 2 s OFF OFF
2 – 3 s OFF ON
3 – 4 s OFF OFF
4 – 5 s ON ON
5 – 6 s OFF OFF

2. Consider 2 LEDs of different colors are connected to two digital pins. Take two integer
numbers (A & B) as user inputs. Now depending on the number following situation will
occur –

Input Number LED 1 LED 2
A is Divisible by B ON OFF
Otherwise OFF ON

3. Design a priority encoder (D3 > D2 > D1 > D0). Take a 4-digit user input (valid binary
combination). Then show the output using two LEDS. Print the word “INVALID” if any
user gives 0000 as Input.

User Input LED 1 LED 0
1111 ON ON
0010 OFF ON
0101 ON OFF
0001 OFF OFF

4. Take two integer inputs from user. After that take a String input from User. Depending on
the string input, perform the relevant arithmetic operation using the two input numbers. If
a user gives wrong string name for arithmetic operation, it would be indicated by turning
on a LED. For valid string inputs LED would be off.
String Operation

Add or + A + B
Subtract or - A - B
Multiply or * A * B
Division or / A / B
Modulus or % A % B
Other LED would be ON

5. Consider we would take an integer input (n) from user. Now write a custom function so
that LED would blink n! (Factorial) times. However, if n! > 50, it would discard the input
and prompt the user to give another input.

Input Value, n = 3 (LED Would Blink 3! = 6 times)
Input Value, n = 4 (LED Would blink 4! = 24 times)
Input Value, n = 5 (as 5! = 120 > 50, it would prompt user to give

another input instead of blinking)

6. Take a 3 Digit Integer Input from a User (A = A3A2A1). Consider we have two LEDs
connected with Arduino board. Now depending on the user input following events would
take place –

Situation LED 1 LED 2
A3 > A1 Blink A2 Times OFF
A3 < A1 OFF Blink A2 Times
A3 = A1 OFF OFF

7. Write a custom function that would take 3 inputs from user. First input would indicate no.
of blinks, second input would indicate ON time in second and the third input would mean
the duty cycle in percentage.

Custom Function Format: blinkLED (a, b, c)

Example – blinkLED (3, 2, 60)

a = 3; // LED would blink 3 times
b = 2; // LED would be ON for 2 second
c = 40; // 40% ON time (Duty Cycle), so LED would be OFF for 60% (= 3s)
