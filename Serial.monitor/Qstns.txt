1. Take User input Radius (r) as Float data. Write a program to calculate the area of the circle.
2. Take 3 numbers as User Inputs (data type INT). Write a program to find out the minimum
among these 3 numbers.
3. Consider an array of 4 elements (initialize inputs in the code). Write a program that
calculates the average of these 4 numbers.
4. Take 2 inputs (integer) from user. Then ask user what arithmetic operation they want to do
with these number (take as a String Input). Then show the output result.

Frist Input: 3
Second Input: 2
Operation: Add
Output = 5
First Input: 16
Second Input: 4
Operation: Division
Output = 4
First Input: 5
Second Input: 7
Operation: Multiplication
Output = 35

5. Take Student ID as a user input. From ID, you have to find out the relevant information
such as Admission year, Term, Department and Roll No.

Student ID: 190205123
Admission Year: 2019
Term: Fall
Department: EEE
Roll. No.: 123
Student ID: 170107089
Admission Year: 2017
Term: Spring
Department: IPE
Roll. No.: 089

6. Design a Binary Encoder (One-Hot encoded). It will take 4-digit binary input from user
and show the equivalent decimal number. It will also check whether user is giving correct
input or not.

Input: 0100
Output: 10 (D2)
Input: 0010
Output: 01 (D1)
Input: 1001
Output: Wrong
