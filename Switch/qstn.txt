1. Design the following basic gates –

No. Basic Gate
1 AND
2 OR
3 NAND
4 NOR
5 XOR
6 XNOR

Take two Slide-switches as two inputs for the gate and use an LED to indicate the gate
output.
2. Consider 2 Push-buttons (One with Internal Pullup and other with External Pulldown
resistor) and 4 LEDs of different colors. Write a code so that following conditions occur
based on which switches are pressed or not –

Push Button 1 LED 1 (R) LED 2 (G)
Pressed ON OFF
Not Pressed OFF ON
Push Button 2 LED 3 (B) LED 4 (Y)
Pressed ON OFF
Not Pressed OFF ON

3. Consider a setup with 3 slide switches and a single LED. Write a code so that LED is turned
on when –

No. of “ON” Switches > No. of “OFF” Switches

4. Design a Full Adder and Full Subtractor. Take inputs using three slide switches. Outputs
would be indicated by 2 LEDs. [*** Use Switch..Case ***]

5. Implement the following function using three slide-switches and one LED for to indicate
output –

f = ∑ m (0, 2, 6, 7)

6. Consider a setup with 3 push-buttons (External Pulldown, External Pullup and Internal
Pullup) and a single LED. Write a code so that LED is turned on when odd number of push
button are pressed.

7. Design a 2 to 1 MUX using two slide switches, one push button and a LED. Two slide
switches would be used to indicate input values (I1 & I0). Push button would be used as
selector (S). Output would be indicated by the LED (Y).
